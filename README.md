# HTML Dialog Element React

In a previous article i have shown how to use the HTML dialog element with React. Since then I have found a way to improve my solution by aligning more closely to the native behavior of the dialog element.

## Use case

To demonstrate the component let's imagine a todo app where the user can delete a to do item. The user should be asked to confirm the deletion.

```tsx
// src/components/Dialog.tsx
```
